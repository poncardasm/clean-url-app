1. Check if the HTML is **well-formed** (all tags properly opened, closed, and nested).
2. Check if the HTML is **valid** according to the HTML5 specification (including attributes, structure, use of required tags, proper doctype, etc.).
3. Improve the HTML for **semantic correctness** (ensure that tags are used for their intended meaning, e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc., instead of generic `<div>` or improper tags).
4. Suggest corrections and then provide a **clean, corrected version of the HTML**.

When you give the corrected version:

- Ensure it passes W3C validation.
- Use best practices for accessibility (a11y), including `alt` attributes for images, `lang` attribute in `<html>`, and proper heading structure.
- Format the HTML code with consistent indentation for readability.

Do not remove meaningful content, only restructure and refine it to meet the standards above.
