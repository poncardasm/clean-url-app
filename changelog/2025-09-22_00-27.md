## ðŸŽ¨ Theme System Implementation

### Added
- **Automatic System Theme Detection**: Implemented comprehensive theme detection that automatically switches between light and dark modes based on user's system preferences

  - Listens for real-time system theme changes
  - Persists theme preference in localStorage
  - Supports "system", "light", and "dark" theme modes

### Modified
- **Root Layout**: Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to integrate ThemeProvider with default "system" theme
